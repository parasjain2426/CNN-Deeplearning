# CNN-Deeplearning
Implementation of CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)
Creating Layers from scratch
1.Convolution(multiplication)2D of an image matrix with a Kernel
2.Activation Function
3.Pooling to extract the features from the image array

# Face-Recognition
Implementation is done using Face-Net Model
Face Detection is done using MTCNN model
